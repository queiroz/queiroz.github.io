      <description>Vim is an open source text editor mainly used by Unix based operating systems, however Vim is cross-platform, meaning it can be used on Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, iOS, Android.
Vim was design to be used on command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.
