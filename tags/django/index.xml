      <description>After a long research I have finally found a good solution to deploy Django settings into several stages, which is production, development and common shared settings.
I have also found a good way to deploy Django overall, which I&#39;ll be writing soon.
Just to clarify, there is not standard way of deploying Django, however I think the method I put together is a very good way for deployment.
Where should the settings be stored?</description>
