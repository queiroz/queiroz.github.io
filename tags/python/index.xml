      <description>After a long research I have finally found a good solution to deploy Django settings into several stages, which is production, development and common shared settings.
I have also found a good way to deploy Django overall, which I&#39;ll be writing soon.
Just to clarify, there is not standard way of deploying Django, however I think the method I put together is a very good way for deployment.
Where should the settings be stored?</description>

      <description>Getting the Python release First we need to go to Python&#39;s source download link at https://www.python.org/downloads/source/{: target=&amp;rdquo;_blank&amp;rdquo; } and choose our Python version, for this tutorial I have chosen Python 3.5.2 as it&#39;s the latest stable release as of this writing.
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/Python-3.5.2.tgz or directory specific:
wget -P /tmp https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/Python-3.5.2.tgz The above command will download python 3.5.2 Gzipped source tarball to the current directory I&#39;m currently in /root, you can specify -P as specified above to save on that directory.</description>
